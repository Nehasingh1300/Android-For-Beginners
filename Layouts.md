# Lesson 1

## View
A View is a rectangular area visible on the screen. It has a width and height, and sometimes a background color.<br>
 An ImageView displays an image such as an icon or photo. A TextView displays text. A Button is a TextView that is sensitive to touch: tap it with your finger and it will respond. And a ViewGroup is a big View—often invisible—that contains and positions the smaller Views inside of it.<br>
 
## ViewGroup
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. For example, a TextView displays text and an ImageView displays an image.<br>
A ViewGroup is a big View that can contain smaller Views inside of it. The smaller Views are called the children of the ViewGroup and might be TextViews or ImageViews. The ViewGroup is called the parent of its children. <br>

### Image View
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. One type of View is an ImageView, which displays an image such as an icon or a photograph.<br>

### Text View
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. One type of View is a TextView, which displays one or more lines of text.<br>

# Lesson 2

## ViewGroups
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. For example, a TextView displays text and an ImageView displays an image.<br>
A ViewGroup is a big View that can contain smaller Views inside of it. The smaller Views are called the children of the ViewGroup and might be TextViews or ImageViews. The ViewGroup is called the parent of its children. <br>

## Root View
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. A big View can contain smaller Views, which in turn can contain even smaller ones. At any given moment, the biggest View of all—the one that contains all the others—is called the root View.<br>

## Parent
A View is a rectangular area on the screen. For example, a TextView displays text and an ImageView displays an image.
